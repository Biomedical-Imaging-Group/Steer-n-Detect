## Outline
Steer 'n' Detect allows fast and reliable detection of structures of interest independently from their location and orientation and in presence of noise. It only requires a single user-provided training example (template) to construct the detector. The method for designing the detector relies on a combination of latest research outcomes on splines, steerability and denoising theory.
