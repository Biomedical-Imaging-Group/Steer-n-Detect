/**   Jama = Java Matrix class.   The Java Matrix Class provides the fundamental operations of numerical   linear algebra.  Various constructors create Matrices from two dimensional   arrays of double precision floating point numbers.  Various "gets" and   "sets" provide access to submatrices and matrix elements.  Several methods    implement basic matrix arithmetic, including matrix addition and   multiplication, matrix norms, and element-by-element array operations.   Methods for reading and printing matrices are also included.  All the   operations in this version of the Matrix Class involve real matrices.   Complex matrices may be handled in a future version.	@author The MathWorks, Inc. and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.	@version 5 August 1998*/package jama;public class Maths {	/** sqrt(a^2 + b^2) without under/overflow. **/	public static double hypot(double a, double b) {		double r;		if (Math.abs(a) > Math.abs(b)) {			r = b / a;			r = Math.abs(a) * Math.sqrt(1 + r * r);		}		else if (b != 0) {			r = a / b;			r = Math.abs(b) * Math.sqrt(1 + r * r);		}		else {			r = 0.0;		}		return r;	}}
